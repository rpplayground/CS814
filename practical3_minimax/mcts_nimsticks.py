# Is current state a leaf node (on the frontier)

# If yes:
# Has it been visited?  ie is n = 0?

# If yes: ROLLOUT
# If no: add successors and then ROLLOUT the first successor

# Loop forever
# Check if state is a terminal state, return utility value of state
# Pick a random action
# Calcualte the next state resulting from that action
