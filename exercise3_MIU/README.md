## Overview
The assignment was to create an algorithm which can for search strings of the MIU system  presented in Chapter 1 of [GÃ¶del, Escher, Bach](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Godel-Escher-Bach-Eternal-Golden/dp/0465026567/).

The MIU system is presented as a puzzle:
> Can you transform the string MI into the string MU?

In order to accomplish this, you are given the following rules:
1. If your string ends with an I, you can add a U on the end: $ xI -> xIU $
2. If the string starts with an M, you can double what comes after it: $ Mx -> Mxx $
